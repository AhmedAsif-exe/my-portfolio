            Hello and welcome! I'm a digital designer and web developer based in
            Pakistan, specialising UI/UX design and web development. I took the
            Cambridge A-level exams from The Science School. The subjects of
            interest were CS, Physics, Chemistry and Maths. I must say that I
            have a knack for CS. Now, I am a university student of National
            University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) doing bachelors
            in? You guessed it COMPUTER SCIENCE!!.
